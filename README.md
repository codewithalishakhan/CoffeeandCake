# CoffeeandCake
HEY, there!
Welcome to my CoffeeandCake project.Basically CoffeeandCake is a nice and simple website with just a few pages.As you see all, I have a list with some links to some 
others pages . Then in last I have a link to contacts page. So, I create the tittle of the top,and then just paste the picture of map and also create two links in 
contact page. When you click on them for ex:- from any smart phone it will show up in contact app and the same thing for another link i.e email it will shows
up automatically in your email provider then I create a link back to the main page when you click to back to main page it will get you to home page.
Also I create two more pages the one's going to be RedVelvet cake. A simple page.
and same as another one that is Sweets.
